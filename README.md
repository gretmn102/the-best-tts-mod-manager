# The Best Tabletop Simulator Mod Manager Ever!!!
The program is created specially for the "Лунные котики" guild. Netlennyy, if you are reading this message, urgently put on a foil cap, because *they* are coming :alien:

## Build
```sh
npm install
```

Finally execute the following command to start Webpack in development mode and watch the changes on source files for live rebuild on code changes.
```sh
npm run dev
```

The `npm run dev` command won't start your app and get your app shows on the screen. To start your app, execute the following command:
```sh
npm start
```

The boilerplate is currently configured to package & build the installer of your app for Windows using `electron-builder`.

```sh
npm run prod
npm run build:win
```
